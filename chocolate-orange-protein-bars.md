- 150g Chocolate flavoured protein powder - 582kcal
- 150g Porridge oats - 552kcal
- 100g Spreadable butter / margarine (Light) - 320kcal
- 1 egg white - 12kcal
- 4 oranges - 400kcal
- 4 squares of dark chocolate - 131kcal

## Equipment
- 2 bowls (one large and one glass)
- Saucepan
- Blender
- Whisk / Handheld electric mixer (trust me it helps)
- Baking tray (or muffin tin)
- Greaseproof paper (or muffin cases)

## Instructions

1. Set the oven to about 160 - 180 degrees.
2. Melt the butter in a saucepan on the hob (on a ver low heat)
3. Cut the oranges into small inch-sized chunks and add to a blender
    - I use the whole orange including the skin. If you don't want to do this then zest one orange into the mix at the end to make it more orangey.
4. Add the egg white to the large bowl and whisk
5. Pour the oranges in with the egg white
6. Add the melted butter and mix the wet ingredients together
7. Add 150g of protein powder and mix
8. Add 150g of porridge oats and mix
9. Mix the whole lot with the electric hand mixer (or whisk) until it's consistent.
    - It should be quick thick. If it's runny you may have used too many oranges or they were too big. No matter; keep adding equal parts porridge oats and protein powder until thick.
10. Line the baking tray with greaseproof paper (or add the muffin cases to the tin)
11. Pour the mix into the tin (or cases).
12. Bake for 15 minutes and check on it. If the top is firm then take them out. If it gives a little then leave for another 5 minutes and check again. The cupcake style ones should only need about 15 mins.
13. Leave to cool.
14. Fill the saucepan with water and boil on the hob.
15. Break of the 4 squares of chocolate and put them in the glass bowl.
16. Place the bowl on top of the saucepan.
    - The heat from the boiling water will melt the chocolate in no time
17. Once melted (and the slab or muffins have cooled) drizzle the melted chocolate of the top or smear it in a thin layer. (Remove the muffins from the tin before drizzling or things get messy)
18. Put them in the fridge.
19. When cool (the shine should be gone from the chocolate) cut the slab into brownie sized pieces. I normally get about 16 out of a batch.
20. Keep in a sealed container in the fridge and enjoy as a snack.

Each bar should be about 125 calories and high in protein
Add some Greek Yoghurt for a boost in good fats too.
